# Predicting-stock-price
A regression model that predicts the stock price.

* The dataset consists of opening, closing, highest, and lowest stock price of each day.

* The prediction is done using the Support Vector Regression from Scikit-learn library.The prediction is based on three different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function). 

* The prediction is checked for accuracy by comparing it with the original stock for that particular day. After comparison, the conclusion is that redial basis function performs better as compared to other two kernels.

* An anaysis paper is also published for the same in IJET journal.
